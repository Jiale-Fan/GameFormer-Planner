# Branch modified_io

This branch is built on branch rl_obj. This version of algorithms takes embedded path proposals as input and output coordinates in frenet coordinates. Relative modules are taken from GameFormer-Planner repo to integrate better with the neural network model. 

### TODO

1. Using frenet output coordinates
2. Only train the corresponding proposal?
